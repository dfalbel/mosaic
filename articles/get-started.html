<p>Mosaic allows creating scalable and interactive data visualizations
using the <a href="https://idl.uw.edu/mosaic/" class="external-link">Mosaic</a> framework
directly from R. You can use Mosaic to create a wide range of
visualizations.</p>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="installation">Installation<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#installation"></a>
</h2>
<p>To install the Mosaic package, you can use the following command in
R:</p>

<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="usage">Usage<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#usage"></a>
</h2>
<p>There are two main use cases of htmlwidgets in R:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Static documents</strong>: You can create a plot and
display in Quarto or RMarkdown documents. The plot will be rendered as
an interactive HTML widget in the output document. There’s no backing
server needed and the data is embedded in the document.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Interactive applications</strong>: You can embed Mosaic
plots in Shiny applications to create interactive dashboards or data
exploration tools. There’s a backing server that can be used to load
data dynamically and respond to user inputs.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The <code>mosaic</code> R package covers both use cases, but the way
we provide the data to generate the plots is slightly different
depending on the context.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="using-in-static-documents">Using in static documents<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#using-in-static-documents"></a>
</h3>
<p>To create mosaic plots, use the <code>mosaic</code> function. First
define a specification. The spec is a list that describes the plot(s)
you want to create with mosaic as well as the data to be used and
optionally more attributes. See the <a href="https://idl.uw.edu/mosaic/api/spec/format.html" class="external-link">specification
documentation</a> for more details.</p>
<p>At its simplest, a spec can be a list with a single plot definition.
Here is an example of a simple scatter plot using the built-in
<code>penguins</code> dataset:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="va">spec</span> <span class="op">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/list.html" class="external-link">list</a></span><span class="op">(</span></span>

<span>    <span class="op">)</span></span>
<span>  <span class="op">)</span></span>
<span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Similar to other grammars, a plot consists of marks — graphical
primitives such as bars, areas, and lines—which serve as chart layers.
Mosaic uses the semantics of Observable Plot, such that each plot has a
dedicated set of encoding channels with named scale mappings such as x,
y, color, opacity, etc. See <a href="https://idl.uw.edu/mosaic/api/vgplot/marks.html" class="external-link">marks API
reference</a> for a full list of available marks and their channels.</p>
<p>Notice that for static documents, we provide the data as a named
argument to the <code>mosaic</code> function. The name of the argument
(here <code>penguins</code>) must match the name used in the spec
(<code>from = "penguins"</code>). In Shiny applications, data is
provided differently (see below).</p>

<p>Loading data this way will embbed the full data into the document,
and this may not be desirable for large datasets. You can also use the
<code>data</code> attribute in the spec to load data asyncronously into
the plot. This also allows acquiring data from a remote server when the
document is visualized. Notice that in this case, the document is no
longer fully self-contained, as it will need to fetch the data from a
server when a client views it.</p>
<p>Files are downloaded from a URL relative to the <code>baseURL</code>
parameter in the <code>mosaic</code> function. By default, this is
pointing to a examples server hosted by the <a href="https://idl.uw.edu" class="external-link">IDL</a>. You should change this to your own
server or a public CDN providing the dataset you want to visualize.</p>

<p>Mosaic supports interactive inputs that can be used to filter or
modify the plot. These inputs are all executed and managed on the client
side, so there’s no need for a backing server to handle the user
interactions. Thus, this can be used in static documents.</p>
<p>Here’s a small example:</p>

<p>To use Mosaic in Shiny applications, you can use the
<code>mosaicOutput</code> function to create a UI output element and the
<code>renderMosaic</code> combined with the <code>mosaic</code>
function. Additionally, you should use the <code>mosaicServer</code>
Shiny module to handle data transfers between the server and the
client.</p>
<p>The <code>mosaicServer</code> is the secret sauce in the mosaic
package, allowing you to visualize datasets with thousands of data
points without overloading the client. It does this by sending only the
data needed to render the current view of the plot, and it can also
execute SQL queries to filter or aggregate data on the server side.
Mosaic is able to make optimzied queries based on the current view, and
on the plot size and resolution. See <a href="https://idl.uw.edu/mosaic/what-is-mosaic/#queries-optimization" class="external-link">Queries
&amp; Optimization</a> for additional information.</p>
<p>The <code>spec</code> syntax is very similar to the one used for
static documents, the main difference is that we’re not going to use the
<code>data</code> field in the <code>spec</code> or provide data as
named arguments to the <code>mosaic</code> function. Instead, we will
insert the dataset we want to visualize into a <code>duckdb</code>
connection and pass that connection to the <code>mosaicServer</code>
module.</p>
<p>Here’s a simple example of a Shiny application that uses Mosaic to
create an interactive scatter plot:</p>
